Group JJSR CIS 550 Project- Movie Trivia

Node.js (NPM) Modules used are listed in 550/package.json

The main modules we used were Express.js (module name: "ejs"), Postgres (module name: "pg"), and Mongo (module names: "mongodb" and "mongoose"). We also used the BCrypt module to encrypt passwords (module name: "bcrypt-nodejs").

Setup should be easy. Just go to the 550 folder and run "node app.js" on your terminal. You should then be able to see the app running on localhost:8080.
Alternatively, you could also visit jjsr.herokuapp.com (this is where our app is hosted online).

Extra credit implemented and other details, including technical specifications are discussed in our project writeup.

Thank you!
